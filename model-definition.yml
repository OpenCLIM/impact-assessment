  summary: Assess flood impacts using OS MasterMap
  description:
    Calculates maximum depths, velocity depth products (VD) and flooded perimeters of flooded buildings.
    Each building is buffered by 5m to extract surrounding depths and VDs.
    Flooded areas are created as polygons where flood depths exceed the provided `THRESHOLD`.
    The intersection of the buffered building polygon boundaries and the flooded areas is then calculated.
    The length of these lines is the flooded perimeter.
    This length is converted to a percentage of the total perimeter of each building.

        description:
          All the buildings generated by the udm-citycat model. This folder should contain at least one file labelled
          buildings_exist.gpkg, which includes all of the existing buildings for the city of interest. If the urban fabric generator
          has produced new building developments, then a second file should be included labelled buildings_udm.gpkg.

        description:
          Lookup between TOID and UPRN identifiers (CSV).
          If provided, this is used to lookup the Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs) for each building.
          Each building may have more than one UPRN and therefore more than one row in the output CSV.

        description:
          CSV files named residential.csv and nonresidential.csv relating depth (m) to damage (£/m2)
          Depths at each building are converted into a damage (£) using these curves.
          Buildings with a MISTRAL `building_use` of residential are assigned damage values based on the `residential.csv` curve.
          All other buildings are assigned damaged values based on the `nonresidential.csv` file.
          Both CSV files are assumed to contain columns names `depth` and `damage`, with depths in metres and damages in £/m<sup>2</sup>.
