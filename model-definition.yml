  summary: Assess flood impacts using OS MasterMap
  description:
    Calculates maximum depths, velocity depth products (VD) and flooded perimeters of flooded buildings.
    Each building is buffered by 5m to extract surrounding depths and VDs.
    Flooded areas are created as polygons where flood depths exceed the provided `THRESHOLD`.
    The intersection of the buffered building polygon boundaries and the flooded areas is then calculated.
    The length of these lines is the flooded perimeter.
    This length is converted to a percentage of the total perimeter of each building.

          All other buildings are assigned damaged values based on the `nonresidential.csv` file.
          Both CSV files are assumed to contain columns names `depth` and `damage`, with depths in metres and damages in £/m<sup>2</sup>.
